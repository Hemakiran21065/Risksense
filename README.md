RiskSense is a specialized tool of insurance designed to cover losses related to cyber incidents, including data breaches, network outages, and cyber extortion. It typically provides financial protection by covering legal fees, costs related to regulatory investigations, data restoration, and even ransom payments. However, calculating the right insurance premium and understanding the actual risk for a business are complex challenges due to the unpredictable nature of cyber threats and the lack of standardized historical data.
The motivation for this research stems from the growing demand for improved risk assessment models in cyber insurance. As organizations continue to digitize their operations, their exposure to cyber threats increases, making it imperative for insurers to adopt more advanced methods of evaluating risk. Moreover, the financial stakes for organizations dealing with cybersecurity incidents have never been higher. According to a study by IBM, the average cost of a data breach in 2023 was $4.35$ million, underscoring the economic impact that cyber incidents can have on businesses
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive framework that utilizes Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning models to improve risk assessments for cyber insurance. Specifically, the project seeks to:
Simulate correlated random variables for threat and vulnerability to capture the complex interplay between cyber risks.
Build a machine learning model to predict risk scores based on these variables.
Develop a dynamic system for calculating insurance premiums based on predicted risk scores.
Implement an automated claims processing mechanism that adjusts payouts based on the client's risk level.
By achieving these objectives, the project will offer insurers a more accurate and reliable method for assessing cyber risk, pricing premiums, and processing claims, ultimately contributing to the stability and sustainability of the cyber insurance market.
